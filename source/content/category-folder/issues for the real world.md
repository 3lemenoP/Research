I recognize that my current framework for unifying the Free Energy Principle (FEP) with Viability Theory simplifies certain practical realities. In particular, it often assumes a fixed viability set $K \subset \mathcal{X}$, holds the environment and constraints as largely known or unchanging, and focuses on single‐agent scenarios under perfect or near‐perfect state observation. While this abstraction helped me present a clean, formal exposition, I also realize that, to make the framework more robust in real‐world settings, I need to address how viability constraints change dynamically, how agents learn about new or uncertain constraints, and how multiple agents or subsystems can coordinate to maintain overall viability. Below, I outline the main ways I plan to refine and extend my current approach.

---

## 1. Time‐Varying or Adaptive Viability Sets

First, I acknowledge that the viability set $K \subset \mathcal{X}$ cannot always remain constant in the real world. As conditions shift—due to environmental changes, parameter drifts, or improvements in the agent’s own capabilities—what it means to be “safe” also shifts. I will therefore consider:

-   **Dynamic Viability Sets:** Instead of a single static set, I plan to treat viability as a time‐indexed or parameter‐indexed set $K(t)$ or $K(\theta,t)$. Here, the system’s boundary of safety depends on the current parameter $\theta$ or time $t$. I believe that re‐computing or updating the viability kernel on the fly will capture how real systems adapt to changing conditions.
-   **Online Constraint Learning:** I intend to incorporate uncertainty in the viability boundary itself, so that $\phi(x)$ or the set $K$ can be learned or updated online. This would mean the agent refines its knowledge of exactly which states are lethal or unsustainable as it explores safely, ensuring that it never has an “all-or-nothing” approach when it comes to new terrain.

By generalizing from a static to a dynamic notion of viability, I can more faithfully model the way living or intelligent systems must adapt their safety envelopes over time.

## 2. Updated Viability Kernels in the Agent’s Belief State

I also want to embed the notion of viability directly into the agent’s internal belief structure. In classical viability theory, the system’s dynamics are fully known, and we compute a viability kernel accordingly. In my FEP‐based approach, the agent continuously learns about uncertain dynamics. Hence:

-   **Estimated Viability Kernel:** I’ll formalize an *estimated* viability set $K_t$ based on the agent’s current posterior distribution over unknown parameters $\theta$. As the agent gathers more data, the posterior shrinks (or changes), and so does the robust viability kernel.
-   **Robust or Bayesian Viability:** I will unify robust‐control ideas (like the “robust viability kernel” that handles worst‐case $\theta$) with Bayesian updating, so that every time the posterior support for $\theta$ narrows, I can refine a region of guaranteed safety.

By making the kernel part of the agent’s belief, I can design an agent that always checks the intersection of safe sets for all plausible models it entertains, thus carefully exploring without risking catastrophic boundary crossings.

---

## 3. Handling Uncertainty and Partial Observability

Furthermore, I see that real systems often have incomplete observations, and the standard viability formulations tend to assume full knowledge of the state $x$. I plan to:

-   **Partially Observed Viability:** Define viability constraints in an expanded state space of belief states or information states, rather than raw physical states alone. In a truly Bayesian spirit, if the agent is uncertain about $x$, it should track a distribution and remain within a “safe distribution” subspace.
-   **Belief‐Space Planning:** Borrow from control‐theoretic or robotics approaches that carry out safe planning in “belief space.” That is, the agent ensures that, with high probability, it stays inside a safe region despite incomplete or noisy sensing.

This step will ensure that my formalism does not rely on perfect knowledge of current system states—an unrealistic assumption for most natural and engineered contexts.

---

## 4. Multi‐Objective Constraints and Dynamic Priorities

In practice, “viability” is often multi‐faceted, covering different constraints (e.g., safety, energy, finances) that can shift in priority. To address that, I plan to:

-   **Multi‐Dimensional Viability:** Let there be multiple constraints, each with its own penalty function $\phi_i(x)$ or safe set $K_i$. A single “big” viability penalty could then be an aggregation of these sub‐constraints, with adjustable weighting $\lambda_i$.
-   **Adaptive Weights:** Because real systems regularly re‐prioritize (consider how a system might suddenly emphasize safety over performance in an emergency), I want these $\lambda_i$ parameters to change in time or with context.

This modification captures the reality that viability is not just about “stay alive or not” but about balancing multiple constraints, some of which can be more or less urgent over time.

## 5. Balancing Active Exploration with Safety

One of the most compelling features of the FEP is its natural incentive for exploration (information gain). However, raw exploration can conflict with a strict viability requirement. My plan:

-   **Constrained or Safe Exploration Schedules:** I will explicitly design policies that allow for exploration when near the boundary only if the agent’s uncertainty about violating the boundary is sufficiently small.
-   **Risk‐Aware EFE Minimization:** The Expected Free Energy (EFE) includes an epistemic value for learning. I can combine that with my viability penalty to produce an integrated objective that penalizes actions whose risk of crossing the viability threshold is too high.

In other words, the agent would perform active inference but with guardrails that keep it from venturing too far into unknown territory if that territory is plausibly lethal.

---

## 6. Numerical and Approximate Methods

I also realize it’s computationally expensive to calculate viability kernels or perform exact Bayesian inference in high‐dimensional settings. So I plan to:

-   **Approximate Viability Computations:** Use set‐valued numerical methods, level‐set approaches, or polynomial (linear matrix inequality) bounding methods to approximate the viability kernel in real time.
-   **Scalable Inference:** Continue employing variational approximations or particle filters to handle the agent’s posterior updates, acknowledging that exact inference is often intractable.

By ensuring my framework includes practical algorithms, I can better demonstrate how an agent might operate online, with real constraints on time and computational resources.

---

## 7. Multi‐Agent and Distributed Viability

I see a need to generalize this unified approach to multi‐agent (or multi‐subsystem) contexts:

-   **Decentralized Viability:** Each agent or subsystem might have local viability bounds, yet they have to coordinate so that the entire collective remains safe.
-   **Sheaf‐Theoretic Compositionality:** I’m excited by topological approaches (like sheaf theory) to systematically combine local viability sets that must agree on overlaps. This is directly relevant to large organizations, ecosystems, or robot swarms, where each part has partial knowledge but must collectively maintain the viability of the whole.
-   **Negotiation and Robustness:** Systems might need game‐theoretic or negotiation‐based strategies to share resources or avoid conflicts that could push one member out of its safe zone.

This multi‐agent perspective is likely the next frontier: real complexity arises when multiple self‐directed entities must remain viable together.

## 8. Formal Convergence and Stability Analyses

I proposed postulates about convergence (e.g., how beliefs converge or how actions remain viable in the long run), but I acknowledge that rigorous proofs require a deeper stability analysis. I will:

-   **Lyapunov‐Based Proofs:** Build on the idea that augmented free energy (incorporating $\phi(x)$) might serve as a Lyapunov function. I aim to show that under certain conditions—perhaps timescale separation between learning and the environment, or bounded disturbances—the overall system remains in a stable region of joint (state + belief).
-   **Handling Noise and Approximation Errors:** Introduce explicit error margins (robustness margins) so that small mistakes in inference or policy do not lead to catastrophic boundary crossings.

I believe that a partial proof, accompanied by empirical demonstrations, will reinforce the soundness of the approach.

---

## 9. Accounting for Non‐Stationary and Delayed Feedback

Finally, real systems are rarely stationary or instantaneous in their feedback loops. I want to:

-   **Shock Handling:** Model abrupt changes in the environment. A system might face a sudden resource cut or drastic shift in parameters that is well beyond small perturbations.
-   **Delayed Observations:** Incorporate typical time delays between a state’s occurrence and the agent’s awareness of that state. This is important for any system with non‐negligible sensor lag or communication delay.
-   **Fail‐Safe or Graceful Degradation:** Consider scenarios where partial boundary crossing is inevitable. The framework should allow for fallback modes or “controlled crashes” so that crossing the boundary in one dimension does not doom the entire system.

Addressing these edge cases will make the theory far more credible in real‐world engineering, ecology, and organizational contexts.

---

## 10. Topological Interpretations and Explorations

Lastly, I want to push further on the promising topological methods I have begun discussing:

-   **Morse Theory for Boundary Ridges:** Use Morse theory to identify “where small moves cause big changes” (i.e., near viability boundary saddles).
-   **Conley Index for Invariant Sets:** Classify attractors or sets within the safe region, letting me detect potential bifurcations that destroy viability.
-   **Persistent Homology to Track Changes in Viability:** Visualize how safe regions appear or disappear as system parameters evolve or learning proceeds.
-   **Sheaf Theory for Multi‐Layer Constraints:** Formally integrate local viability constraints across nested or overlapping subsystems.

Such tools complement the FEP with more global, structural insights into how viability shapes (and is shaped by) the topology of state space. I think this direction can yield novel results and possibly new computational algorithms.

## Concluding Thoughts

By implementing these refinements—ranging from dynamic viability sets and partial observability to explicit multi‐objective trade‐offs and multi‐agent considerations—I will make the FEP–Viability Theory unification significantly more robust, applicable, and realistic. Ultimately, I want a framework that models how intelligent systems (biological or artificial) truly behave: not just as Bayesian prediction machines, but as agents bound by survival constraints that shift over time. This means carefully balancing exploration with safety, learning new constraints as one goes, and adapting in response to emergent phenomena.

I also plan to emphasize practical, implementable algorithms or at least computationally viable approximations. If successful, this next step will turn the framework into a genuinely usable paradigm for designing and analyzing adaptive, self‐maintaining agents.
