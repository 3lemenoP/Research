title: Some Research
---
	
Hello world!

This site is a living collection of my thoughts, insights, and explorations (thrown into an AI model for a bit more coherence) at the intersection of the Free Energy Principle, Viability Theory, and Cybernetics. Here, I openly share my ongoing researchâ€”ranging from theoretical unifications to practical frameworks such as the **Cybernetic Surprise Framework (CSF)**.

My hope is that this open format invites curiosity, collaboration, and dialogue. Feel free to browse around, question, suggest, and engage with the ideas.

Happy exploring!
