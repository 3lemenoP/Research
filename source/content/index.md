title: Some Research

Hello, and welcome!

This site is a living collection of my thoughts, insights, and explorations (thrown into an AI model for a bit more coherence) at the intersection of the **Free Energy Principle, Viability Theory, and Cybernetics**. Here, I openly share my ongoing research—ranging from theoretical unifications to practical frameworks, such as the Cybernetic Surprise Framework (CSF).

My research is focused on understanding, modeling, and forecasting **viable systems**—systems defined by their inherent capacity to sustain themselves and persist within dynamic environments over time. A viable system is one whose internal structure and interactions allow it to adapt, regulate, and self-maintain effectively, enabling it to remain stable under varying conditions. My goal is to develop rigorous theoretical frameworks that capture this idea of viability in a formal, generalizable way, across different domains and scales of complexity. Since humanity itself is a viable system, introducing advanced artificial intelligence (AGI or ASI) means adding new agents whose viability directly influences our own. Ensuring alignment means aligning these new intelligences with the conditions necessary not only for their viability but for ours as well—making viability and alignment deeply interconnected challenges.

My hope is that this open format invites curiosity, collaboration, and dialogue. Feel free to browse around, question, suggest, and engage with the ideas.

Happy exploring!
