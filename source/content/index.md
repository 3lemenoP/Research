Research Statement [[README]]
---

This site is a living collection of my thoughts, insights, and explorations (thrown into an AI model for a bit more coherence) at the intersection of the **Free Energy Principle, Viability Theory, and Cybernetics**. Here, I openly share my ongoing research—ranging from theoretical unifications to practical frameworks, such as the Cybernetic Surprise Framework (CSF).

My research is focused on understanding, modelling, and forecasting **viable systems**—systems defined by their inherent capacity to sustain themselves and persist within dynamic environments over time. Since humanity itself is a viable system, introducing advanced artificial intelligence (AGI or ASI) means adding new agents whose viability directly influences our own. Ensuring alignment means aligning these new intelligences with the conditions necessary not only for their viability but for ours as well—making viability and alignment deeply interconnected challenges.

My hope is that this open format invites curiosity, collaboration, and dialogue. Feel free to browse around, question, suggest, and engage with the ideas.

Happy exploring!

# My Research Hierarchy (by Volatility)

Below is the workflow I follow to move ideas from scattered beginnings to stable knowledge, ordered from lowest to highest volatility.

1. **KNOWLEDGE CRYSTALLIZATION**  
   This is my lowest-volatility stage where I keep validated ideas that have essentially “solidified.”  

2. **PATTERN SYNTHESIS**  
   Here, I distill recurring themes and start creating coherent structures around them.

3. **GENERATIVE PROCESSING**  
   In this stage, I reflect on raw materials and generate initial connections or commentary.

4. **ENTROPY COLLECTION**  
   My most volatile stage—where I gather raw materials (quotes, links, half-formed ideas) without filtering or organizing.

## KNOWLEDGE CRYSTALLIZATION
Here are my most developed and validated pieces of research, as well as any reviews or critiques.

## PATTERN SYNTHESIS
Here, I organize emerging ideas into structured drafts that may eventually crystallize.

| Title                                                                                          |

## GENERATIVE PROCESSING
Here’s where I work through more loosely formed reflections, partial analyses, and early-stage conceptual links... Area for things I'm learning about. 

| Title                                                                        |

## ENTROPY COLLECTION
This is the raw, disordered space where I toss random links, fleeting thoughts, quotes, and any unfiltered material.

| Title                               |

## Misc Documents, Thoughts, etc.
If something doesn’t fit neatly into the volatility hierarchy above, I keep it here. These might be ephemeral ideas or random notes I haven’t incorporated anywhere else. Also books I've found particularly interesting.
