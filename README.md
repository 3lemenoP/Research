# Cybernetic Surprise Framework

## A Unified Theory of Adaptive Viability Under Uncertainty

Welcome to my research repository where I'm exploring how complex adaptive systems maintain viability in the face of surprise and uncertainty.

---

## Research Overview

I'm developing the **Cybernetic Surprise Framework (CSF)**, which aims to integrate insights from several foundational theories:

- **Viable System Model (VSM)** - Stafford Beer's recursive organizational structures for survival
- **Free Energy Principle (FEP)** - Karl Friston's theory of cognitive systems minimizing surprise through predictive modeling
- **Viability Theory** - Mathematical framework for maintaining systems within essential constraints
- **Autopoiesis & Allopoiesis** - Self-production and environmental adaptation

This synthesis proposes that **all viable systems are essentially surprise minimization engines** that continuously cycle through anticipating, sensing, interpreting, and responding to maintain their existence across scales.

## Key Research Directions

1. **Mathematical Integration**: I'm working to unify viability kernels with free energy minimization through an augmented free energy functional that encodes safety constraints.
    
2. **Fractal Organization**: I'm investigating how viability and surprise minimization operate recursively across scales in nested systems.
    
3. **Dual Adaptation Mechanisms**: I'm formalizing how systems respond to surprise through autopoiesis (internal changes) and allopoiesis (external changes).
    
4. **Multi-Temporal Optimization**: I'm modeling how systems balance immediate responses, mid-range adaptations, and long-term evolution.
    

## Current Focus

My active research areas include:

- **Computational Simulations**: Developing agent-based models to test the unified framework across various domains
- **Empirical Validation**: Analyzing real-world cases of organizational and biological adaptation through the CSF lens
- **Practical Applications**: Creating decision support tools for organizational strategy and policy planning

## Why This Matters

This research has implications for:

- **Organizational Resilience**: Helping institutions adapt to rapid change and uncertainty
- **AI Safety & Control**: Providing a framework for designing systems that safely navigate novel environments
- **Biological Systems**: Understanding how living systems maintain integrity amid disruption
- **Social Coordination**: Modelling how collective behaviours emerge from individual adaptations

## Collaboration Opportunities

I'm seeking collaborators interested in:

- **Mathematical formalization** of the Augmented Free Energy models
- **Software development** for simulating multi-agent CSF systems
- **Domain expertise** to translate the framework to specific fields (organizations, biology, AI)
- **Funding partnerships** to support computational research and publications
